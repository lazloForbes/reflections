When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

- When I want to collaborate with other people and share my project. It is also
- a good way to backup the files.

New commands:

- "git push nameOfRepository" - use when I want to push files to GitHub
- "git pull nameOfRepository branchToPullTo" - use when I want to pull files
- from GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because if I'm working on a project I maby don't want new code that could
- interfer with what I've done.
