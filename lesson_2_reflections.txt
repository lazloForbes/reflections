What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- An directory .git is created where the computer saves all of my commits.
- Good question!

New commands I've learned:

"git init" - create a repository
"git add filename" - works on the staging area
"git status" - works on the staging area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

- You put thing in the staging area before you make a commit. Files in the
- staging area will be commited when you commit.
- The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project.
- These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory
- and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
- It probably adds the value of not commiting to many files. in each version.
- This would save a lot of discspace instead of saving multiple version of
- all possible files.
