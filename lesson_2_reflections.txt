What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- An directory .git is created where the computer saves all of my commits.
- Good question!

New commands I've learned:

- "git init" - create a repository
- "git add filename" - works on the staging area
- "git status" - works on the staging area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

- You put thing in the staging area before you make a commit. Files in the
- staging area will be commited when you commit.
- The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project.
- These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory
- and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
- It probably adds the value of not commiting to many files. in each version.
- This would save a lot of discspace instead of saving multiple version of
- all possible files.

New commands:

- "git diff" - gives the difference of the files in the staging area and the 
- working directory
- "git diff --staged" - gives the difference of the files in the staging area
- and the repository
- "git reset --hard" - removes changes on the working directory that has not
- been added to the staging area. (Be careful when you use this to not lose
- and of your work)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

- By only adding files that have anything to do with the logical change.
- By this I mean files that are affected by the change should be added, no
- other files.

New commands:

- "git branch" - gives all the possible branches
- "git branch branchName" - creates a new branch with the name branchName

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

- If I want to experiment with my code but don't want to manipulate the working
- version of the code. Another possibility is if I want to make a bigger update
- of the code, like go from 1.0.x to 1.1.x. Yet another possibility is i I want
- to make a version in another language or something like that.
- Branches would help me in a way the codes apart so that I don't have to look
- through all of my commits.
